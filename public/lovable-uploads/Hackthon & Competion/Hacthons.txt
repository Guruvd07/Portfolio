5) Avinya
üöÄ Honored to receive the Best Paper Award at AVINYA 2025! üèÜüéâ
I am thrilled to share that our research paper, "AI-Driven Emotion and Sentiment Analysis for Early Mental Health Detection," was recognized with the Best Paper Award at AVINYA 2025 - Undergraduate Students' Conference, held at MIT Academy of Engineering, Pune.
Mental health issues are often detected late due to the limitations of traditional clinical methods. Our research leverages advanced AI models, including BERT-Large, to analyze both text and voice data in real time, offering deeper emotional insights. This scalable and AI-driven system bridges the gap between conventional assessments and AI-powered mental health evaluation, enabling early intervention and improved patient outcomes.
This achievement would not have been possible without the collaboration and support of my co-authors:
